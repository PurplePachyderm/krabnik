# [WIP] Krabnik : a UCI compliant chess engine written in Rust

Krabnik is a [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) compliant chess engine written in Rust as a side project, both to play with the language and learn about chess programming.

## Build & install

Krabnik is written in Rust, so building and installing it is done with Cargo :

``` sh
cargo build
cargo install
```

### Test suite

Each module comes with its own tests. The full Krabnik test suite can be run with :

``` sh
cargo test
```

### Documentation

Once again, HTML documentation can be generated with Cargo :

``` sh
cargo doc
```

## Usage
